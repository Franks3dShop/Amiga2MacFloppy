         ***  AMIGA INTERFACE for MacIntosh 800 KB DISK DRIVE.  ***

This is a new release of the project, because there was a bug in the picture-
file in the earlier release. +5V and +12V were connected, which blew a fuse 
on my Amiga 2000 motherboard (the motherboard must be removed from the case 
to replace it, and that takes quite e long time :-( ).

I do not know who made the original hack, but apart from the rather serious 
bug in the pic-file it is quite nice work.

I have totally redrawn the scematics, and shown a suggestion of how a PCB can 
be made. It is not a very professional layout, with a single sided board, and 
a lot of jumpers, but on the other hand, it is very easy to build for the 
less experienced (like myself ;-) ).

I build the board and used it with a SONY MP-F51W-23 drive from a dead 
MacPlus. It works very fine with A-Max II. If you get a drive without a BD19 
connector, note the orientation of the wires on the drive:

Upper row 19 17 15 13 11  9 7 5 3 1  <- pin one marked with a V
Lower row 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2

I. To build the interface, you will need:

1 - 74LS139 Dual 2 to 4 line converter  !USE LS TYPE! Don't use HCT etc.!!!
1 - 74LS393 Dual 4-bit binary counter        !SUBSTITUTES NOT ALLOWED!
2 - 1N4148 small signal diodes
1 - DB23 Male (To Amiga)
1 - DB23 Female (To external drive)
1 - DB19 Female (To Mac Drive)
1 - Box (Radio Shack #270-230)
    Wire, perf board etc.

III. SIMPLIFIED Procedure:

Cut  holes in the project case for the connectors.  I put the DB23's on the
ends  and  the mounted the DB19 on the "bottom" of the case.  Thus what was
the top now became the bottom.  If you align the connectors just right, you
will  be  able  to  slide the interface into the computer without having to
lift  either  the  interface  or  the  computer.   I  put some small rubber
stick-on feet on the aluminum cover near the screws to act as feet.

You  can  make  the interface single ended or with the pass-through for the
external  drive.   When  wiring  up  with  the  pass-through, note that all
signals  are connected between both Amiga connectors, except for the select
lines.   These  lines  are  moved  over  by one.  The SEL1 line goes to the
interface circuitry, and the other select lines are moved to the next lower
logical  line  on  the  pass through connector.  IE SEL2 Amiga goes to SEL1
external etc.  SEL3 is not connected.

If you decide that you don't want or need the pass-through, you may need to
add  1k  ohm pull up resistors on the signal lines of the DB-19 (pins 11 to
19)  in  order to get reliable operation.  Wire the resistors with one lead
connected to the signal line, and the other connected to the +5v supply.

Almost  any  construction techniques will work, although I generally prefer
point  to point soldering on the perf boards with copper pads when building
small  projects.   Use  a  fine wire such as wire wrap wire, and check your
work!

IV. A few notes....

REMEMBER!   If  you  are adding this to your Amiga 1010 drive, the +12 V is
NOT  passed  through  by  the  A1010.   You must modify the drive to do so.
Verify  that  your  particular  drive(s)  passes  all lines by testing this
interface  at  the computer and on the end of your daisy chain of drive(s).
If it fails on the end of the drive, and not on the computer, then you need
to trace the drives signal wires to find what line(s) are missing.
